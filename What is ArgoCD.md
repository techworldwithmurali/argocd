### ‚úÖ **What is ArgoCD?**

**ArgoCD (Argo Continuous Delivery)** is a **Kubernetes-native continuous delivery tool** that follows a **GitOps** approach. It automatically deploys the desired application state defined in Git repositories to Kubernetes clusters and keeps them in sync.

> Think of it as a **GitOps-based CD system** that ensures what's in your Git repo is always what‚Äôs running in your cluster.

### ‚úÖ **Why Do We Use ArgoCD?**

**Key reasons to use ArgoCD:**

* üîÅ **GitOps Workflow**: Git is the single source of truth for both app code and cluster config.
* üîí **Security**: No need to expose your cluster to CI tools. ArgoCD pulls manifests, not pushed by external tools.
* üîÑ **Auto-sync**: Detects changes in Git and syncs automatically or manually.
* üîç **Drift Detection**: Identifies if the live state of an app differs from what‚Äôs defined in Git.
* üåê **Web UI & CLI**: Easy monitoring and debugging of deployments.
* üîÅ **Rollback support**: Revert to previous Git commits easily.
* üîß **Multi-cluster support**: Manage multiple clusters from a single ArgoCD instance.

### ‚úÖ **Architecture of ArgoCD**

ArgoCD is made of four main components:

1. ### **API Server**

   * Acts as the **central control plane**.
   * Provides REST & gRPC endpoints.
   * Communicates with the UI, CLI, and other ArgoCD components.
   * Handles RBAC, auth, and user interactions.

2. ### **Repository Server**

   * Clones and monitors Git repositories.
   * Generates manifests from Helm/Kustomize/Jsonnet/YAML.
   * Keeps track of Git commit history and changes.

3. ### **Application Controller**

   * Compares desired state (from Git) vs actual state (in the cluster).
   * Performs sync operations.
   * Handles auto-sync, self-healing, status reporting, and health checks.

4. ### **UI (Web Interface)**

   * User-friendly dashboard to monitor apps, see diff/drift, sync, rollback, etc.
   * Visual representation of deployments and their status.

### ‚úÖ **Difference: Jenkins vs GitHub Actions vs ArgoCD**

| Feature               | Jenkins                                      | GitHub Actions                           | ArgoCD                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Type**              | CI/CD (script-based)                         | CI/CD (GitHub-native)                    | CD (GitOps-based, Kubernetes-native) |
| **Best Use Case**     | Build/Test/Deploy (monoliths, microservices) | Lightweight CI/CD for GitHub-hosted code | Continuous delivery to Kubernetes    |
| **Deployment Method** | Push-based (pipeline executes deploy)        | Push-based                               | Pull-based (GitOps)                  |
| **Kubernetes Native** | No                                           | Partial (with runners/scripts)           | Yes                                  |
| **UI**                | Plugin-based                                 | Minimal (Logs & Workflow view)           | Rich, visual deployment UI           |
| **Drift Detection**   | No                                           | No                                       | Yes                                  |
| **Rollback Support**  | Manual                                       | Manual                                   | Native via Git history               |

### ‚úÖ **How ArgoCD is Different from Other CD Tools**

| Tool          | Type           | Approach           | Notable Differences                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ArgoCD**    | GitOps CD      | Pull-based         | Kubernetes-native, UI, automatic drift detection, sync strategies            |
| **FluxCD**    | GitOps CD      | Pull-based         | Lightweight, better Git integration, CLI-driven (no built-in UI like ArgoCD) |
| **Spinnaker** | Multi-cloud CD | Push-based         | Supports hybrid/multi-cloud deployments, large/complex systems, but heavy    |
| **Jenkins X** | CI/CD for K8s  | GitOps + Pipelines | CI + CD in GitOps style, opinionated, requires more setup                    |
| **Harness**   | Enterprise CD  | Push-based         | SaaS, commercial tool, feature-rich but not open-source                      |

**Summary:**

* **ArgoCD vs Flux:** ArgoCD has a built-in UI and stronger app-centric model. Flux is more modular and CLI/GitOps focused.
* **ArgoCD vs Spinnaker:** ArgoCD is lighter and Kubernetes-native; Spinnaker supports multi-cloud and complex pipelines.
* **ArgoCD vs Jenkins CD:** Jenkins is script-heavy and push-based; ArgoCD is declarative and pull-based.
